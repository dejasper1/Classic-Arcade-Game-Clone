# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Description 
This is a game project inspired by the classic Frogger game. The gameplay consists of a player controlled character, multiple enemies, and a tile grid. The objective is to guide the character to the top of the grid (water tiles) without colliding with an enemy. 10 points are awarded for each move upward and 100 points for reaching the water tiles. After reaching the water tile or colliding with an enemy the player position is reset. When the player runs out of attempts a modal with the score displayed is presented with an option to play again.

The visual assets and game loop engine (found in the engine.js file) were provided by Udacity.
